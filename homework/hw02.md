## Math 2001 Homework 2

**Due date: 1 February by 1pm**

1. (**LaP 2.5.2**) Here's a logic puzzle by George J. Summers, called "Murder in the Family." Murder occurred one evening in the home of a father and mother and their son and daughter.  One member of the family murdered another member, the third member witnessed the crime, and the fourth member was an accessory after the fact.  \

    (a) The accessory and the witness were of opposite sex.
    (b) The oldest member and the witness were of opposite sex.
    (c) The youngest member and the victim were of opposite sex.
    (d) The accessory was older than the victim.
    (e) The father was the oldest member.
    (f) The murderer was not the youngest member.\

    Which of the four---father, mother, son, or daughter---was the murderer? Solve this puzzle, and write a clear argument to establish that your answer is correct.  Use grammatically correct English sentences (not a natural induction derivation tree).

2. (**LaP 15.5.1**) Let $f$ be any function from $X$ to $Y$, and let $g$ be any function from $Y$ to $Z$.\
    a.  Show that if $g \circ f$ is injective, then $f$ is injective.\
    b.  Give an example of functions $f$ and $g$ as above, such that that $g \circ f$ is injective, but $g$ is not injective.\
    c.  Show that if $g \circ f$ is injective and $f$ is surjective, then $g$ is injective.

<!--
#. Let $f$ and $g$ be as in the last problem. Suppose $g \circ f$ is surjective.
    a. Is $f$ necessarily surjective? Either prove that it is, or give a counterexample.
    b. Is $g$ necessarily surjective? Either prove that it is, or give a counterexample. 

#. (**LaP 15.5.3**) A function $f$ from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ is said to be
   *strictly increasing* if whenever $x_1 < x_2$, $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$.
    a.  Show that if $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is strictly increasing, then it is injective (and hence it has a left inverse).
    b. Show that if $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is strictly increasing, and $g$ is a right inverse to $f$, then $g$ is strictly increasing.

#. Let $f : X \to Y$ be any function, and let $A$ and $B$ be subsets of $X$. Show that $f [A \cup B] = f[A] \cup f[B]$.

#. (**LaP 15.5.16**) Let $f: X \to Y$ be any function, and let $A$ and $B$ be any subsets of $X$. Show $f[A] \setminus f[B] \subseteq f[A \setminus B]$. 

#. (**LaP 15.5.6**) Define notions of composition and inverse for binary relations that generalize the notions for functions. -->
