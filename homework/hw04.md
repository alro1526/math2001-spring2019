**Exercises: LaP 5.3. 1--7**

**Due Friday 22 February by 2pm**


1. (**5.3.1**) Show how to derive the proof-by-contradiction rule from the law of the excluded middle, using the other rules of natural deduction. In other words, assume you have a proof of $\bot$ from $\neg A$. Using $A \vee \neg A$ as a hypothesis, but *without* using the proof-by-contradiction rule (RAA), show how you can go on to derive $A$.

2. (**5.3.2**) Give a natural deduction proof of $\neg (A \wedge B)$ from $\neg A \vee \neg B$. (You do not need to use proof by contradiction.)


3. (**5.3.3**) Construct a natural deduction proof of $\neg A \vee \neg B$ from $\neg (A \wedge B)$. You can do it as follows:

    a. First, prove $\neg B$, and hence $\neg A \vee \neg B$, from $\neg (A \wedge B)$ and $A$.

    b. Use this to construct a proof of $\neg A$, and hence $\neg A \vee \neg B$, from $\neg (A \wedge B)$ and $\neg (\neg A \vee \neg B)$.

    c. Use this to construct a proof of a contradiction from $\neg (A \wedge B)$ and $\neg (\neg A \vee \neg B)$.

    d. Using proof by contradiction, this gives you a proof of $\neg A \vee \neg B$ from $\neg (A \wedge B)$.

4. (**5.3.4**) Give a natural deduction proof of $\neg A \vee B$ from $A \to B$. You may use the *Law of the Excluded Middle* (LEM).

5. (**5.3.5**) Put $(A \vee B) \wedge (C \vee D) \wedge (E \vee F)$ in disjunctive normal form, that is, write it as a big "or" of multiple "and" expressions.


6. (**5.3.6**) Prove $\neg (A \wedge B) \to \neg A \vee \neg B$ by replacing the sorry's below by proofs.

```lean
       open classical
       variables {A B C : Prop}

       -- Prove ¬ (A /\ B) → ¬ A \/ ¬ B by replacing the sorry's below 
       -- by proofs.

       lemma step1 (h₁ : ¬ (A /\ B)) (h₂ : A) : ¬ A \/ ¬ B :=
       have ¬ B, from sorry,
       show ¬ A ∨ ¬ B, from or.inr this

       lemma step2 (h₁ : ¬ (A /\ B)) (h₂ : ¬ (¬ A \/ ¬ B)) : false :=
       have ¬ A, from
         assume : A,
         have ¬ A \/ ¬ B, from step1 h₁ ‹A›,
         show false, from h₂ this,
       show false, from sorry
 
       theorem step3 (h : ¬ (A /\ B)) : ¬ A \/ ¬ B :=
       by_contradiction
         (assume h' : ¬ (¬ A \/ ¬ B),
           show false, from step2 h h')
```

7. (**5.3.7**) **Optional** (solutions to this exercise need not be submitted)


```lean
       open classical
       variables {A B C : Prop}

       example (h : ¬ B → ¬ A) : A → B := sorry

       example (h : A → B) : ¬ A \/ B := sorry
```
